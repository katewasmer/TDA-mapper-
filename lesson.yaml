  Version: 2.4.4
  
- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to the module on principal components analysis!
  
#Explaining what PCA is. 
- Class: text
  Output: Principal components analysis (PCA) is an essential part of data analysis. It allows us to analyze thousands of variables by reducing the data to 2 or 3 simple components to accurately interpret the data. 

#1D data example.
- Class: figure
  Output: Let's look at a simple dataset built using basic R commands. 
  Figure: simpledataset.R
  FigureType: new

#Explaining what a PCA line is.   
- Class: text
  Output: Now how do we perform a PCA? To do so, we need to find the line that encompasses the most data.  
  
#Explaining how the PCA line matches up with the data provided.   
- Class: figure
  Output: Therefore, we want a straight line through all of the data points. 
  Figure: PCAlinebasic.R
  FigureType: new
  
#1D dataset with a PCA performed 
- Class: figure
  Output: Now, here is this dataset with a PCA performed. Since the data is 1D, we only need one axis to succinctly summarize the data. Consequently, we have cut the data storage by half, since now the data is only represented by an x-coordinate. 
  Figure: PCAbasic.R
  FigureType: new

#2D dataset with 30 points that lies approximately on a line, but with variation using the set.seed() and runif functions.   
- Class: text
  Output: Now, let's look at a dataset with some variation. 

- Class: figure
  Output: How would the PCA line look in this case? 
  Figure: simplevariation.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: figure
  Output: Notice that the line passes through many of the points, but it's not a perfect fit like the previous example. 
  Figure: PCA1variation.R
  FigureType: new 

#Explanation for why we need 2 PCA lines.   
- Class: text
  Output: To account for the lack of a perfect fit, we need a second PCA line. 
#NOTE--figure out dimensions for the graph so that it's consistent and also forms a right angle 
  
#Definition of PCA2 compared to PCA1  
- Class: figure
  Output: For any PCA, the second PCA line will be perpendicular to the first, as shown here. Notice the right angle formed by these lines.
  Figure: PCA2variation.R
  FigureType: new
  
#Rotating the 2D dataset   
- Class: text
  Output: We want to rotate the graph so that the PCA1 line is parallel to the x-axis. 
 
- Class: figure
  Output: By doing this, we will get a rotated plot that looks like this. 
  Figure: PCAsimplerot.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: text
  Output: Notice that the data points generally lie along this line, but some diverge slightly below or above it. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: The majority of datasets you work with won't be as simple as two we previously saw, however. 

#Introducting to 3D datasets 
- Class: text
  Output: Rather than a 1D or 2D dataset, let's look at a 3D dataset and see how we can perform a PCA.
  
#Install scatterplot3d whenever you need to view or work with a 3D dataset  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In order to view a 3D dataset, we need to install the scatterplot3d package built in R. Please type the following; if (!require(package = "scatterplot3d")){install.packages(pkgs = "scatterplot3d")}
  CorrectAnswer: EXPR 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='if (!require(package = "scatterplot3d")){install.packages(pkgs = "scatterplot3d")}')
  Hint: Did you remember to use the install.packages function? 
  
#Cone data   
- Class: figure
  Output: Here, we have the dataset of a cone. 
  Figure: Data3D.R
  FigureType: new 
  
- Class: text
  Output: While this example is more complicated, we can still perform a PCA on the dataset as before. 

#PCA lines for cone dataset 
- Class: figure
  Output: Since the data is 3D, we will get 3 PCA lines, as shown here. These lines encompass the majority of the dataset. 
  Figure: Data3DPCA.R
  FigureType: new 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Notice that the 3 lines are perpendicular to one another, just like in the previous example with 2D data.

#Explaining orthogonality for PCA lines   
- Class: text
  Output: No matter how many dimensions the dataset has, each PCA line will always be orthogonal to the previous line. 
  
- Class: figure
  Output: Here is the cone projected onto the x-y plane. 
  Figure: PCA3Drotation12.R
  FigureType: new 

#Explaining PCA projections and how to project correctly 
- Class: text 
  Output: This projection shows what the top of the cone looks like, if we sliced it into an infinite number of 2D planes. 

- Class: text
  Output: While this projection is accurate, it isn't particularly reflective of the general shape of the cone. 
  
- Class: figure
  Output: Let's see what happens if we project onto the x-z plane instead. 
  Figure: PCA3Drotation13.R
  FigureType: new 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Much better! Now we have a more relevant image, with the cone being rotated upside down.

- Class: text
  Output: How was I able to find the PCA lines and transform the figures? Let's do an example of our own. 

#Student example - flares dataset, from figure TDAflarecode.R

#figure out bug here 
- Class: cmd_question
